## üìà Performance Metrics

### With 1 Worker (Sequential):
```
9 tests √ó ~28 seconds = ~4.3 minutes
```

### With 20 Workers (Parallel):
```
45 tests √∑ 20 workers = ~2 minutes
Speedup: ~10x faster!
```

### With 50 Workers (Maximum):
```
100 tests √∑ 50 workers = ~2.5 minutes
Speedup: ~20x faster!
```

## üéØ Test Execution Examples

### Run All Smoke Tests:
```powershell
npm run test:azure:smoke
```

**Output:**
```
Running 9 tests using 20 workers on Azure Linux browsers
  ‚úì Login test @smoke (1.2s)
  ‚úì Search test @smoke (0.9s)
  ‚úì Profile test @smoke (1.5s)
  ...
  9 passed (30s)

Reports generated:
  - playwright-report/index.html
  - results.json
  - junit.xml
  - allure-results/
```

### Run Critical Tests Only:
```powershell
npm run test:azure:critical
```

### Run Specific Test File:
```powershell
npx playwright test --config=playwright.service.config.ts test/specs/login.spec.ts --workers=20
```

### Run With Custom Tags:
```powershell
npx playwright test --config=playwright.service.config.ts --grep "@regression" --workers=30
```

## üìä Available Reporters

All these reports are generated automatically:

| Reporter | Output | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **list** | Console | Real-time progress |
| **html** | playwright-report/ | Visual test report with screenshots |
| **json** | results.json | Machine-readable results for dashboards |

| **allure-playwright** | allure-results/ | Detailed Allure reports with trends |
| **github** | Annotations | GitHub Actions inline annotations |

## üåê Azure Cloud Benefits

### Why Use Azure vs Local?

| Feature | Local (1 worker) | Azure (20 workers) |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Speed** | 4.3 min for 9 tests | 2 min for 45 tests ‚ö° |
| **Parallelization** | 1 test at a time | 20 tests simultaneously |
| **Resources** | Uses your machine | Cloud infrastructure |
| **Scalability** | Limited by CPU | Up to 50 workers |
| **Cost** | Free | Pay per test minute |

### When to Use Azure:

- ‚úÖ **Large test suites** (100+ tests)
- ‚úÖ **Fast feedback needed** (CI/CD pipelines)
- ‚úÖ **Multiple browsers** simultaneously
- ‚úÖ **Peak testing times** (releases, sprints)
- ‚úÖ **Limited local resources**

### When to Use Local:

- ‚úÖ **Debugging** individual tests
- ‚úÖ **Development** and test writing
- ‚úÖ **Small test runs** (< 10 tests)
- ‚úÖ **Cost optimization** for frequent runs

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Tests Running Locally Instead of Azure?

**Check:**
```powershell
# Verify environment variables are loaded
Get-Content .env | Select-String "PLAYWRIGHT"

# Should show:
# PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_URL=wss://...
# PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
```

**Solution:**
- Ensure `.env` file exists
- Verify variables are set correctly
- Restart your terminal

### Authentication Errors?

**Error:** `401 Unauthorized`
**Solution:**
- Check access token hasn't expired
- Regenerate token in Azure Portal
- Update `.env` file

### OS Parameter Error?

**Error:** `OS value must be Windows or Linux`
**Solution:**
- Already fixed! URL now includes `?os=linux`
- Or change to `?os=windows` if needed

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. View Your Test Results:

```powershell
# HTML Report
npx playwright show-report

# Allure Report
npm run report

# Azure Portal
start https://portal.azure.com/
```

### 2. Run More Tests:

```powershell
# All tests with maximum workers
npm run test:azure:50workers

# All tests across all browsers
npm run test:azure
```

### 3. Add to GitHub Actions:

Your workflows are already configured! When you push to GitHub:
```
- Tests run automatically
- Results published to GitHub Actions
- Artifacts available for download
```
