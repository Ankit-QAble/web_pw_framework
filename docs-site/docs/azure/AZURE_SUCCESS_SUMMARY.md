# ‚úÖ Azure Playwright Testing - SUCCESSFULLY CONFIGURED!

## üéâ Congratulations! Your Azure Setup is Complete

Your tests are now configured to run on **Microsoft Azure Playwright Testing** cloud infrastructure!

---

## ‚úÖ What We Configured

### 1. Environment Variables (.env file)
```env
PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_URL=https://eastus.api.playwright.microsoft.com/playwrightworkspaces/0fa190f2-5550-4ce2-a2d0-d810ae890137
PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_ACCESS_TOKEN=eyJhbGc... (your token)
```

### 2. Configuration Files Updated
- ‚úÖ `playwright.service.config.ts` - Uses Azure Playwright service with access token auth
- ‚úÖ `playwright.azure.config.ts` - Alternative config with Azure cloud browsers
- ‚úÖ `package.json` - Added new Azure test scripts

### 3. Verification
When we ran the test, we saw:
```
Running tests using Playwright workspaces.
Test run created successfully.
```
‚úÖ **This confirms Azure connection is working!**

## üöÄ How to Run Tests on Azure

### **Recommended Commands:**

```bash
# Run tests with Azure service config (10 workers)
npm run test:azure:service:10workers

# Run tests with Azure service config (default workers)
npm run test:azure:service

# Run specific tests on Azure
npm run test:azure:service -- test/specs/login.spec.ts

# Run with specific tags
npm run test:azure:service -- --grep "@smoke"
```

### **Alternative Azure Config Commands:**

```bash
# Using the azure config (may have different behavior)
npm run test:azure:10workers
npm run test:azure:50workers
npm run test:azure:smoke
npm run test:azure:critical
```

## üìä What Happens When Tests Run on Azure

1. **Cloud Browsers**: Tests run on Microsoft's cloud-hosted browsers (no local browser needed)
2. **High Parallelization**: Run up to 50 tests simultaneously
3. **Faster Execution**: Microsoft's infrastructure provides fast, reliable test execution
4. **Cross-Platform**: Test on Windows, Linux, and macOS browsers
5. **Scalable**: Pay only for what you use

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### About "Grid Mode: DISABLED" Message
- **Ignore this message** - it refers to LambdaTest/BrowserStack grid, NOT Azure
- When you see "Running tests using Playwright workspaces" - that means Azure is active!

### Memory Issues
If you encounter memory errors:
- Reduce the number of workers: `--workers=5` or `--workers=1`
- Run fewer tests at once
- Run specific test files instead of all tests

### Access Token
- Your token is valid for the duration you set when creating it
- When it expires, generate a new one from Azure Portal
- Update the `.env` file with the new token

---

## üîç Verify Azure Connection

Run this simple test to confirm Azure is working:

```bash
npm run test:azure:service -- test/specs/login.spec.ts:55 --project=chromium
```

You should see:
```
Running tests using Playwright workspaces.
Test run created successfully.
```

---

## üìà Monitor Your Tests in Azure Portal

1. Go to https://portal.azure.com/
2. Navigate to your Playwright Testing workspace
3. View test runs, results, and usage metrics
4. Check billing and resource consumption

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Issue: 500 Error
- **Solution**: Check access token is valid and not expired
- Regenerate token if needed

### Issue: Authentication Failed
- **Solution**: Verify `PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_ACCESS_TOKEN` in `.env`
- Ensure no extra spaces or line breaks

### Issue: Tests Still Running Locally
- **Solution**: Use `npm run test:azure:service` command (not the regular test command)
- Check that `.env` file exists and has correct values

### Issue: Memory Errors
- **Solution**: Reduce workers: `--workers=5`
- Run smaller test subsets
- Close other applications

---

## üìÅ Configuration Files Reference

### Main Azure Config: `playwright.service.config.ts`
- Uses `@azure/playwright` package
- Automatic access token authentication
- Production-ready configuration

### Alternative Config: `playwright.azure.config.ts`
- Custom Azure setup
- More configuration options
- Useful for special requirements

### Environment File: `.env`
- Stores Azure credentials
- **Never commit this file to Git!**
- Already in `.gitignore`

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Run your first Azure test**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:azure:service -- --project=chromium
   ```

2. **Scale up gradually**:
   - Start with 10 workers
   - Increase to 20-50 as needed
   - Monitor Azure usage/costs

3. **Integrate with CI/CD**:
   - Use in GitHub Actions
   - Use in Jenkins
   - Use in Azure DevOps

4. **Monitor and optimize**:
   - Check test execution times
   - Review Azure portal for insights
   - Optimize test parallelization

---

## üí∞ Cost Management

- Azure Playwright Testing charges per minute of browser usage
- Monitor usage in Azure Portal
- Set budget alerts
- Consider using different worker counts for different test suites
