## 🔧 Customization Examples

### Run Only Smoke Tests

```yaml
# Disable other stages in azure-pipelines.yml:
- stage: SmokeTests
  condition: succeededOrFailed()  # Always run

- stage: FullTests
  condition: false  # Disabled
```

### Add New Test Stage

```yaml
- stage: RegressionTests
  displayName: 'Run Regression Tests'
  dependsOn: Setup
  jobs:
    - job: RunRegressionTests
      pool:
        vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
      steps:
        - script: npx playwright test --grep="@regression"
          displayName: 'Run Regression Tests'
```

### Change Browser Matrix

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    chromium:
      BROWSER: 'chromium'
    # Add more browsers:
    edge:
      BROWSER: 'msedge'
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Pipeline Fails at Browser Install

**Solution:**
```yaml
# Ensure install step has --with-deps flag:
- script: npx playwright install --with-deps
```

### Issue: Tests Timeout

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Increase timeout in playwright.azure.config.ts:
timeout: 90000,  // 90 seconds
actionTimeout: 45000,
```

### Issue: Artifacts Not Publishing

**Solution:**
```yaml
# Add condition: always() to publish tasks:
- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
  condition: always()
```

### Issue: Environment Variables Not Working

**Solution:**
```yaml
# Ensure variables are passed to script:
- script: npm test
  env:
    BASE_URL: $(BASE_URL)
    TEST_USERNAME: $(TEST_USERNAME)
```

### Issue: Cache Not Working

**Solution:**
```yaml
# Verify cache key matches your package file:
- task: Cache@2
  inputs:
    key: 'npm | "$(Agent.OS)" | package-lock.json'
    path: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/node_modules'
```

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Current Performance

```
✅ Parallel execution across 3 browsers
✅ npm package caching (saves ~1-2 min)
✅ Stages run in parallel where possible
✅ Total pipeline time: ~15-20 minutes
```

### Further Optimization

```yaml
1. Increase parallel workers:
   - stage: SmokeTests
     jobs:
       - job: RunSmokeTests
         strategy:
           parallel: 5  # Run 5 jobs in parallel

2. Use self-hosted agents:
   pool:
     name: 'My-Agent-Pool'  # Faster than hosted

3. Optimize test suite:
   - Split large test files
   - Use test sharding
   - Run critical tests first
```

## 📊 Monitoring and Analytics

### Built-in Analytics

```
Pipelines → Analytics
- Success rate trends
- Duration trends
- Failure analysis
- Test pass rate
```

### Custom Dashboards

```bash
1. Go to Dashboards
2. Click "New Dashboard"
3. Add widgets:
   - Build history
   - Test results
   - Pass rate trend
   - Duration trend
```

### Export Test Data

```bash
# Download test results JSON:
Pipeline Run → Artifacts → test-results-json

# Use for custom reporting or analysis
```

---

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### Secret Management

```bash
✅ Use pipeline variables for secrets
✅ Mark sensitive variables as "Secret"
✅ Use Azure Key Vault for production
❌ Never commit secrets to repository
❌ Don't log secret values
```

### Access Control

```bash
1. Project Settings → Pipelines → Security
2. Configure permissions:
   - Who can edit pipelines
   - Who can approve runs
   - Who can access artifacts
```

   - Review screenshots for visual verification
   - Analyze JSON results for trends

3. **Monitor Pipeline Performance**
   - Track average duration
   - Identify slow tests
   - Optimize based on metrics
