```bash
# Runs automatically on:
# - Push to main/master/staging
# - Pull requests
# - Daily schedules
# - Manual triggers

# View at: https://github.com/YOUR_REPO/actions
```

### Environment-Specific Testing

The framework supports multiple environments (development, preprod, production) with separate configuration files:

```bash
# Run tests in development environment
npm run test:dev

# Run tests in pre-production environment
npm run test:preprod

# Run tests in production environment
npm run test:prod

# Switch environment using the utility script
npm run switch-env development
npm run switch-env preprod
npm run switch-env production
```

Each environment uses its own `.env.[environment]` file with specific configuration values.
```

### Cloud Testing (BrowserStack/LambdaTest/Azure)

The framework supports running tests on cloud platforms like BrowserStack, LambdaTest, and Azure Playwright Testing. Configuration is managed through `playwright.config.ts` profiles.

#### Running Tests on BrowserStack

```bash
# Run all tests on BrowserStack
npm run test:browserstack

# Run only @smoke tagged tests on BrowserStack
npm run test:browserstack:smoke

# Run only @critical tagged tests on BrowserStack
npm run test:browserstack:critical

# Run both @smoke and @critical tagged tests
npm run test:browserstack:tags
```

#### Running Tests on LambdaTest

```bash
# Run all tests on LambdaTest
npm run test:lambdatest

# Run only @smoke tagged tests
npm run test:lambdatest:smoke

# Run only @critical tagged tests
npm run test:lambdatest:critical

# Run both @smoke and @critical tagged tests
npm run test:lambdatest:tags
```

#### Direct Commands (BrowserStack)

```bash
# Single tag (use equals sign for Windows compatibility)
npx browserstack-node-sdk playwright test --grep="@smoke"
npx browserstack-node-sdk playwright test --grep="@critical"

# Multiple tags (see note below about Windows limitation)
npx browserstack-node-sdk playwright test --grep="@smoke|@critical"
```

**⚠️ Windows Note:** Due to a BrowserStack SDK limitation on Windows, the pipe operator `|` in grep patterns doesn't work properly with the SDK. The `test:browserstack:tags` script uses a PowerShell workaround (`scripts/run-browserstack-tags.ps1`) that runs each tag sequentially.

#### Direct Commands (LambdaTest)

```bash
# Single tag
npx playwright test --grep "@smoke"
npx playwright test --grep "@critical"

# Multiple tags (works on all platforms)
npx playwright test --grep "@smoke|@critical"

# PowerShell examples with specific test file
npx playwright test "test/specs/login.spec.ts" --grep "@smoke"
npx playwright test "test/specs/login.spec.ts" --grep "@critical"
npx playwright test "test/specs/login.spec.ts" --grep "@smoke|@critical"

# With specific project
npx playwright test --grep "@smoke" --project=chromium
npx playwright test --grep "@critical" --project="chrome:latest@Windows 11"
```

#### Running Tests on Azure Playwright Testing

Microsoft Azure Playwright Testing provides scalable cloud-hosted browsers for running your Playwright tests with faster execution and parallel testing capabilities.

**Prerequisites:**

#### Troubleshooting Cloud Testing

**Issue: Tests not running with tags on BrowserStack**

**Solution:**
1. Ensure tags are in the test **title**, not just in metadata:
   ```typescript
   // ✅ Correct
   test('Login test @smoke', { tag: ['@smoke'] }, async () => { ... });
   
   // ❌ Incorrect
   test('Login test', { tag: ['@smoke'] }, async () => { ... });
   ```

2. Use the equals sign syntax for single tags:
   ```bash
   npx browserstack-node-sdk playwright test --grep="@smoke"
   ```

3. For multiple tags on Windows, use the npm script:
   ```bash
   npm run test:browserstack:tags
   ```

4. Verify tests are found locally first:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --list --grep "@smoke"
   ```

#### Environment Configuration Files

The framework uses the following environment files:

- `.env.development` - Development environment settings
- `.env.preprod` - Pre-production environment settings
- `.env.production` - Production environment settings

#### Using Environment Variables in Tests

Access environment variables in your tests using the `EnvConfig` utility:

```typescript
import { envConfig } from '../../framework/utils/EnvConfig';

// Get base URL for current environment
const baseUrl = envConfig.getBaseUrl();

// Get any environment variable with optional default value
const timeout = envConfig.get('ACTION_TIMEOUT', '30000');

// Get current environment name
const environment = envConfig.getEnvironment();
```

#### Creating Custom Environment Files

To add a new environment:

1. Create a new file named `.env.[your-environment]`
2. Add your environment-specific variables
3. Update the `switch-env.js` script to include your new environment
```

## Tagging tests and running by tag

Add tags directly in the title of tests or suites. **Important:** For BrowserStack/LambdaTest compatibility, tags MUST be included in the test title, not just in the tag metadata.

```typescript
// ✅ Correct: Tag in test title (works everywhere)
test('Enter valid credentials @smoke', { tag: ['@smoke'] }, async ({ logger }) => {
  // ...
});

// ✅ Tag the whole suite
test.describe('Login Page Tests @smoke', () => {
  // tests...
});

// ❌ Incorrect: Tag only in metadata (doesn't work with --grep)
test('Enter valid credentials', { tag: ['@smoke'] }, async ({ logger }) => {
  // This won't be found by --grep "@smoke"
});
```

### Run tests by tag locally:

- PowerShell
```powershell
$env:PROJECT="sadad-en-chromium-staging"; npx playwright test "test/specs/login.spec.ts" --project=chromium --grep "@smoke"
```

- Multiple tags (run any):
```powershell
$env:PROJECT="sadad-en-chromium-staging"; npx playwright test --grep "@smoke|@auth"
```

- Exclude a tag:
```powershell
$env:PROJECT="sadad-en-chromium-staging"; npx playwright test --grep "@auth" --grep-invert "@slow"
```

### Run tests by tag on cloud platforms:

See the [Cloud Testing](#cloud-testing-browserstacklambdatest) section above for BrowserStack and LambdaTest commands.

## 📝 Writing Tests

### Basic Test Structure

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '../../framework/core/BaseTest';
import { LoginPage } from '../pages/LoginPage';

test.describe('Login Tests', () => {
  let loginPage: LoginPage;

  test.beforeEach(async ({ page, logger }) => {
    loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
    await loginPage.navigateToLogin();
  });

  test('should login successfully', async ({ logger }) => {
    await logger.step('Enter credentials', async () => {
      await loginPage.login({
        username: 'test@example.com',
        password: 'password123'
      });
    });

    await logger.step('Verify login success', async () => {
      expect(await loginPage.isLoginSuccessful()).toBeTruthy();
    });
  });
});
```

### Creating Page Objects

```typescript
import { Page } from '@playwright/test';
import { BasePage } from '../../framework/core/BasePage';
import { MyPageLocators } from '../locators/MyPageLocators';

export class MyPage extends BasePage {
  private locators: MyPageLocators;

  constructor(page: Page, url?: string) {
    super(page, url);
    this.locators = new MyPageLocators(page);
  }

  async performAction(): Promise<void> {
    const element = this.locators.getLocator('myElement');
    await this.click(element);
  }
}
```

### Creating Locators

```typescript
import { Page } from '@playwright/test';
import { BaseLocators } from './BaseLocators';

export class MyPageLocators extends BaseLocators {
  constructor(page: Page) {
    super(page);
  }

  protected initializeLocators(): void {
    this.addLocator('myElement', {
      selector: '[data-testid="my-element"]',
      description: 'My important element',
      timeout: 10000
    });
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Playwright Configuration

Edit `playwright.config.ts` to customize:
- Test directory
- Browser projects
- Timeouts
- Reporters
- Base URL

### Environment Configuration

Edit `test/data/environments.json` to add new environments:

```json
{
  "myEnvironment": {
    "baseUrl": "https://my-env.example.com",
    "apiUrl": "https://api-my-env.example.com",
    "features": {
      "twoFactorAuth": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Test Data Management

The framework supports loading test data from JSON files located in `test/data/`.

#### Using the users.json Data File

**Structure of users.json:**
```json
{
  "validUsers": [
    {
      "username": "90336607",
      "password": "QAble@2020",
      "otp": "333333",
      "firstName": "Admin",
      "lastName": "User",
      "address": {
        "street": "123 Admin Street",
        "city": "New York",
        "country": "USA"
      }
    }
  ],
  "invalidUsers": [
    {
      "username": "invalid@example.com",
      "password": "wrongpassword",
      "expectedError": "Invalid username or password"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### How to Use Test Data in Your Tests

**Method 1: Direct JSON Import (Recommended)**

```typescript
import { test } from '../../framework/core/BaseTest';
import { LoginPage } from '../pages/LoginPage';
import userData from '../data/users.json';

test.describe('Login Tests', () => {
  let loginPage: LoginPage;

  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
    await loginPage.navigate();
  });

  test('should login with valid user @smoke', async ({ logger }) => {
    // Access valid user data
    const validUser = userData.validUsers[0];
    
    await logger.step('Login with valid credentials', async () => {
      await loginPage.login(validUser.username, validUser.password);
    });
    
    await logger.step('Verify login successful', async () => {
      // Your assertions here
    });
  });

  test('should show error for invalid user @negative', async ({ logger }) => {
    // Access invalid user data
    const invalidUser = userData.invalidUsers[0];
    
    await logger.step('Attempt login with invalid credentials', async () => {
      await loginPage.login(invalidUser.username, invalidUser.password);
    });
    
    await logger.step('Verify error message', async () => {
      // Verify expectedError message is displayed
    });
  });

  test('should use user profile data @smoke', async ({ logger }) => {
    const user = userData.validUsers[0];
    
    // Access nested data
    console.log(`User: ${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`);
    console.log(`Address: ${user.address.street}, ${user.address.city}`);
    console.log(`OTP: ${user.otp}`);
  });
});
```

**Method 2: Using Node.js fs Module**

```typescript
import { test } from '../../framework/core/BaseTest';
import { LoginPage } from '../pages/LoginPage';
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';

test.describe('Login Tests with Dynamic Data', () => {
  let loginPage: LoginPage;
  let testData: any;

  test.beforeAll(() => {
    // Load data dynamically
    const dataPath = path.join(__dirname, '../data/users.json');
    const rawData = fs.readFileSync(dataPath, 'utf-8');
    testData = JSON.parse(rawData);
  });

  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
    await loginPage.navigate();
  });

  test('should login with valid user', async () => {
    const user = testData.validUsers[0];
    await loginPage.login(user.username, user.password);
  });
});
```

**Method 3: Data-Driven Testing (Multiple Users)**

```typescript
import { test } from '../../framework/core/BaseTest';
import { LoginPage } from '../pages/LoginPage';
import userData from '../data/users.json';

test.describe('Data-Driven Login Tests', () => {
  // Test with all valid users
  userData.validUsers.forEach((user, index) => {
    test(`should login successfully - User ${index + 1} @smoke`, async ({ page, logger }) => {
      const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
      await loginPage.navigate();
      
      await logger.step(`Login with user: ${user.username}`, async () => {
        await loginPage.login(user.username, user.password);
      });
      
      await logger.step('Verify login successful', async () => {
        // Your assertions
      });
    });
  });

  // Test with all invalid users
  userData.invalidUsers.forEach((user, index) => {
    test(`should fail login - Invalid User ${index + 1} @negative`, async ({ page, logger }) => {
      const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
      await loginPage.navigate();
      
      await logger.step('Attempt invalid login', async () => {
        await loginPage.login(user.username, user.password);
      });
      
      await logger.step('Verify error message', async () => {
        // Verify user.expectedError is displayed
      });
    });
  });
});
```

**Method 4: Creating Helper Functions**

```typescript
// test/utils/DataHelper.ts
import userData from '../data/users.json';

export class DataHelper {
  static getValidUser(index: number = 0) {
    return userData.validUsers[index];
  }

  static getInvalidUser(index: number = 0) {
    return userData.invalidUsers[index];
  }

  static getAllValidUsers() {
    return userData.validUsers;
  }

  static getRandomValidUser() {
    const users = userData.validUsers;
    return users[Math.floor(Math.random() * users.length)];
  }
}

// Usage in test
import { test } from '../../framework/core/BaseTest';
import { LoginPage } from '../pages/LoginPage';
import { DataHelper } from '../utils/DataHelper';

test('should login with helper @smoke', async ({ page }) => {
  const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
  const user = DataHelper.getValidUser(0);
  
  await loginPage.navigate();
  await loginPage.login(user.username, user.password);
});
```

#### Adding More Test Data

To add more users, simply update `test/data/users.json`:

```json
{
  "validUsers": [
    {
      "username": "90336607",
      "password": "QAble@2020",
      "otp": "333333",
      "firstName": "Admin",
      "lastName": "User"
    },
    {
      "username": "90336608",
      "password": "QAble@2021",
      "otp": "444444",
      "firstName": "Test",
      "lastName": "User2"
    }
  ],
  "invalidUsers": [
    {
      "username": "invalid@example.com",
      "password": "wrongpassword",
      "expectedError": "Invalid username or password"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Creating Additional Data Files

You can create separate data files for different test scenarios:

- `test/data/users.json` - User credentials
- `test/data/products.json` - Product test data
- `test/data/config.json` - Configuration data
- `test/data/environments.json` - Environment-specific settings

Example: `test/data/products.json`
```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": "PROD001",
      "name": "Test Product",
      "price": 99.99,
      "category": "Electronics"
    }
  ]
}
```

Usage:
```typescript
import productData from '../data/products.json';

test('should add product to cart', async ({ page }) => {
  const product = productData.products[0];
  // Use product.id, product.name, etc.
});
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Page Objects
- Keep page objects focused on a single page or component
- Use descriptive method names
- Return meaningful data from methods
- Handle waits and assertions appropriately

### Locators
- Prefer data-testid attributes
- Use semantic locators when possible
- Provide fallback selectors
- Add meaningful descriptions

### Tests
- Use the step pattern for better reporting
- Keep tests independent and atomic
- Use meaningful test and describe names
- Clean up test data when necessary

### Error Handling
- Use try-catch blocks for expected failures
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Take screenshots on failures
- Log important actions and verifications

## 🐛 Debugging

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run in debug mode
npm run test:debug

# Debug specific test
npx playwright test login.spec.ts --debug
```

### Screenshots and Videos
- Screenshots are automatically taken on failure
- Videos are recorded for failed tests
- Use `takeScreenshot()` method for custom captures

### Logging
```typescript
// Different log levels
logger.debug('Debug information');
logger.info('General information');
logger.warn('Warning message');
logger.error('Error message');

// Step logging for reports
await logger.step('Step description', async () => {
  // Your test actions
});
```

## 🔧 Jenkins Diagnostic Tools

The framework includes specialized diagnostic tools for Jenkins CI environments to help troubleshoot common issues.

### Environment Diagnostic

Check Jenkins environment setup, system resources, and dependencies:

```bash
# Run environment diagnostic
npm run diagnose:jenkins
```

This script checks:
- Environment variables (CI, JENKINS, BUILD_NUMBER, etc.)
- System resources (memory, disk space)
- Node.js and npm versions
- Playwright installation and browser availability
- Project structure and required files
- Playwright cache directories and permissions

### Browser Diagnostic

Test browser behavior and page stability in Jenkins environment:

```bash
# Run browser diagnostic
npm run diagnose:browser
```

This script performs:
- Browser launch with Jenkins-optimized settings
- Navigation testing with extended timeouts
- Network idle validation
- Page stability checks (50-second extended wait)
- Element presence verification
- Screenshot capability testing
